## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/definition/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/definition/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/definition/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/definition/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/definition/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a flashcard).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/definition/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the definition book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/definition/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the definition book data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.
Example of class diagram for addCommandParser:
![classDiagram0](images/classDiagram0.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sort feature

The sort feature sorts the flashcards in the flashcard list in either ascending or descending order of priority. This feature is implemented
by creating an instance of `SortCommand` that can be executed on the model of the flashcard list. This particular implementation of the sort
feature was chosen because it accesses and modifies the internal flashcard list in the same way as other commands such as `ListCommand`, hence
preserving consistency in the program design.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort feature works:

![sort0](images/Sort0.png)

When the user executes a sort command, e.g. `sort asc`, `ParserUtil#parseSortOrder()` is called. This function trims whitespaces from the user
input and converts it to lowercase. Hence, user inputs that are in lowercase, uppercase, or both, e.g. `AsC`, are all valid. If the user does not
provide an argument, `asc` will be passed into the `SortCommand` object and the flashcard list will be sorted in ascending order of priority by
default.

The following activity diagram shows how user input is processed:

![sort1](images/Sort1.png)

### \[Proposed\] Quiz feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed quiz feature is facilitated by `QuizPaser` and `Question`.  `Question` is an abstract class and `Mcq` and `TrueFalse` extends Question. There are a few methods within Questions:

* `getPrompt() ` — Provides question description.
* `getQuestion()` — Provides both question description and options.
* `checkResponse(String response)` — Checks if the response is the same as the correct answer.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#startQuiz()`,`Model#enterQuiz()`,`Model#exitQuiz()` `Model#endQuiz()` and `Model#attemptQuestion()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how to do quiz.

Step 1. The user launches the application and DSAce shows the default page with list of flashcards.

![UndoRedoState0](images/state0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `enter quiz` command to switch GUI interface. The `enter quiz` command calls `Model#enterQuiz()`, causing the change in interface and list of questions are displayed. The user can now answer questions with `attempt` command.

![UndoRedoState1](images/state2.png)

Step 3. The user finishes questions and executes `end quiz` command to end the current attempt, which will be stored. The result will be displayed.

![UndoRedoState2](images/state3.png)

Step 4. The user executes `past performance` during quiz mode to see past attempt performance. The list of past attempt is shown in sequence of time and number of correct answers.

![UndoRedoState4](images/state1.png)

Step 5. The user executes `exit quiz`, which calls `Model#exitQuiz`. The GUI interface is switch back to flashcard mode.

![UndoRedoState5](images/state4.png)


#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire definition book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the flashcard being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
